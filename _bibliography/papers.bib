    abstract = "Emergent modified gravity presents a new class of gravitational theories in which the structure of space-time with Riemannian geometry of a certain signature is not presupposed. Relying on crucial features of a canonical formulation, the geometry of space-time is instead derived from the underlying dynamical equations for phase-space degrees of freedom together with a covariance condition. Here, a large class of spherically symmetric models is solved analytically for Schwarzschild-type black hole configurations with generic modification functions, using a variety of slicings that explicitly demonstrate general covariance. For some choices of the modification functions, a new type of signature change is found and evaluated. In contrast to previous versions discussed for instance in models of loop quantum gravity, signature change happens on timelike hypersurfaces in the exterior region of a black hole where it is not covered by a horizon. A large region between the horizon and the signature-change hypersurface may nevertheless be nearly classical, such that the presence of a signature-change boundary around Lorentzian space-time, or a Euclidean wall around the Universe, is consistent with observations provided signature change happens sufficiently far from the black hole.",

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
