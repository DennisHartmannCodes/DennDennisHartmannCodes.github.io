My first long term research project outside of my NSF REU at UPenn, and a smaller project on the connectivity of cubits in open quantum systems, was concerned with black holes in Emergent Modified Gravity. Working with Martin Bojowald at Penn State, we noticed that in Emergent Modified Gravity, it is possible for black holes to form a boundary in space where the metric signature goes from Lorentzian to Euclidean. In other words, there is a Lorentzian region of space that acts the way we usually expect General Relativity to behave, and a Euclidean counterpart, where the same intuition becomes more complex.

This effect is of high interest in the quantum gravity community since signature change is also predicted by Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG), and the effect we proposed in our paper occurs at a highly macroscopic scale. In some sense, understanding the signature change metric we proposed could be highly useful in providing better insight into the inner workings of LQG.
