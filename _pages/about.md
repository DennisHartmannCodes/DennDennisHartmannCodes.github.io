I am a research asistant in the department of Astronomy and Astrophysics as well as in the Institute for Gravitation and the Cosmos (IGC). Much of my undegraduate work was focused on trying to develop a better understanding of gravity and how it might behave at a quantum scale. For the most part, I am still working on this post graduation, but have also joined the Penn State High Energy Astrophysics Detector Instrumentation ([HEADI](https://sites.psu.edu/headilab/)) Lab which is focused on detector characterization for the upcoming BlackCAT (Black Hole Coded Aperture Telescope).
