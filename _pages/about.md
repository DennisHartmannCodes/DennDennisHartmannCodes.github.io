I am a research asistant in the department of Astronomy and Astrophysics as well as in the Institute for Gravitation and the Cosmos ([IGC](https://igc.psu.edu)). Much of my undegraduate work was focused on trying to develop a better understanding of gravity and how it might behave at a quantum scale. For the most part, I am still working on this post graduation, but have also joined the Penn State High Energy Astrophysics Detector Instrumentation ([HEADI](https://sites.psu.edu/headilab/)) Lab which is focused on detector characterization for the upcoming [BlackCAT](https://techport.nasa.gov/view/96341) (Black Hole Coded Aperture Telescope) CubeSat mission in collaboration with NASA.

To dive a little deeper into my undergraduate work, initially I worked on several projects specific to fundamental questions of quantum mechanics. The first project I worked on was about enhancing the methods by which computers preform Hamiltonian calculations for ensembles of Bose-Einstein condensates. Mainly, my focus was on developing a package that exploited mathematical simplifications atributed to mean field approximations. 

Following this, I did an REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates) funded by the NSF (National Science Foundation) at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.lrsm.upenn.edu/outreach/reu/) (UPenn). As part of my project, I aided [Andrea Liu's](https://live-sas-physics.pantheon.sas.upenn.edu/people/standing-faculty/andrea-liu) group study and simulate [learning metamaterials](https://www.lrsm.upenn.edu/highlight/an-electronic-metamaterial-capable-of-decentralized-physics-driven-learning/). The generic term of learning metamaterial refers to materials that have been identified or engineered to have the ability to measurably adapt to some outside influence which we might interpret as learning. For instance, the resistor network featured on the UPenn page acts in a nearly identical manner to a typical neural network, where the current flowing through the circuit can be influenced by the resistance of nodes, much like the evolution of information through a network. The tuning of these networks occurs in a very similar manner as well, the resistance of the nodes can be considered a learning-degree-of-freedom and may be adjusted using the same algorithms widely used to train networks to perform specific tasks. My specific project was to simulate these networks and characterize their suseptibility and resistance to damage. Since the idea of learning metamaterials is to physically exist, it is highly likely that some level of dammage will occur to them over time, thus knowing how a network might react or evolve is useful for ruther action. One specific type of network dammage tracked was the cutting of nodes during and after the learning phase, then studying to what degree the network is able to adapt and proceed with nominal operations.

Returning from this project, my focus shifted to working on qubit interactions within open quantum systems...

Eventually, I started working on formulation of General Relativity called [Emergent Modified Gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06375), which is a relatively new approach to furthering our understanding of gravity. Its claim to fame is that it is mathematically comparable to formulations of [Loop Quantum Gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04394) (LQG) and models of [Loop Quantum Cosmology](https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0601085) (LQC) such as [polymerization](https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10323847) models. Arguably a more important effect of the formulation is that it manifests spacetime [covariance](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.108.084066) on account of the Hamiltonian structure afforded through the [ADM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.10103)-like [foliation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foliation) from a 4-dimensional spacetime to a 3-dimensional space indexed by a 1-dimensional time refered to as 3+1D.
