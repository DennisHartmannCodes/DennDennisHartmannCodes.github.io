My work in the department of Astronomy and Astrophysics at Penn State is a relatively new position for me that I am still only in the early phases of. For that reason, this page will be updated frequently with new happenings as they manifest. Later paragraphs will detail my work within the HEADI lab to more and more juicy detail, for now though all I can say is that it has been a fantastic choice to join from a learning perspective. I have been having a great time absorbing as much information as possible regarding various engineering challenges.

As of about the first month, I have worked on several vacuum systems, dissasembling them, putting them back together again. Working on these systems, I have learned how to maintain the parts and put together junctions that are highly resistant to leaks. I have put these skills to the test multiple times when testing vaccum gauges and LN2 sorption pumps, and while working on the "long cell" a vacuum chamber that runs the entire length of Osmond laboratory used for XRay studies.

Furthermore, I have done a few CAD projects that have broken off a lot of the rust from my highschool experiences with CAD and 3D printing. Initially, I designed and printed a tube to elevate an LED light off of an instrument panel so that it was visible from the test stand it was located at. This helped the lab comply with federal radiation safety protocols as the light was used to tell the stand operator when XRays were being emitted from an Fe55 source past a shutter. This starting project also let me utilize my long-held passion for soldering. Another version of this LED holder is also used on an instrument panel used on the long cell. (Thermal cad stuff)
